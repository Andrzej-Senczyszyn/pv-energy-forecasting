 PV Energy Yield Forecasting Using Meteorological Data and Machine Learning
Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing historical meteorological data and forecasting photovoltaic (PV) energy yield using machine learning models. It was developed as part of my postgraduate diploma thesis in Big Data – Analytics and Society at Collegium Da Vinci.

Objectives
Analyze meteorological factors affecting PV energy production.

Build predictive models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest.

Forecast PV energy yield for 2030 based on historical data (2005–2023).

Dataset
Source: PVGIS — Photovoltaic Geographical Information System

Period: 2005–2023

Features: Solar irradiation, sun angle, air temperature, wind speed, PV installation intensity.

Tools & Technologies
Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)

Jupyter Notebook

Data Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn

Machine Learning: regression models, decision trees, random forest
